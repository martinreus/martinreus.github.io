Hey, good to see you here! I am a software engineer who already had the opportunity to work in Brazil, Germany and Portugal (currently where I am based right now). In more ten years of professional experience I was able to work with and learn a lot from really amazing people!

Writing for this website helps me consolidate all I learn with the problems I have to overcome when I program - and also helps me remember it! Writing it down will also hopefully allow you, dear reader, to solve your problems!

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the reading!

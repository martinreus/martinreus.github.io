But then after some time my brain will try really hard to make me forget stuff. That's why I am writing it down now in the hopes I can find it later - and maybe it will also help you ;)"

Hey, good to see you here! I am a software developer who already had the opportunity to work in Brazil, Germany and Portugal (currently where I am based right now). In my more than ten years of professional experience I was able to work with and learn a lot from really awesome people!

Writing for this website helps me consolidate all I learn with the problems I have to overcome when I program - and also helps me remember about cool stuff I find in the internet. Writing it down will also hopefully allow you, dear reader, to solve your problems!

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the reading!

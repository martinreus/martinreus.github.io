description: "Hi, I'm Martin. Most of the time I develop software. And when I program, sometimes I do not know how to do stuff. An then I search about stuff and learn. But then after some time, my brain tricks me and makes me forget stuff. So with this website I intend to write down stuff I learn so that it is forged into my brain and in the process I hope to also help others solve their problems! :)"

Hey, good to see you here! I am a software developer who had the opportunity to work in Brazil, Germany and Portugal (currently where I am based right now). In my more than 10 years of professional experience I was able to work with and learn a lot from really awesome people!

Writing for this website helps me consolidate all I learn with the problems I have to overcome when I program - and also helps me remember about cool stuff I find in the internet. Writing it down also hopefully will allow you, dear reader, to solve your problems!

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the reading!
